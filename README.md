> **Hosting:** This app is being hosted at [Firebase](https://questmatch2023.web.app)

## Steps to use the app

### User registration

1. The user registers for an account(we will be using firebase authentication for that)
1. The user verifies their email and registers successfully
1. The user logs in, updates their profile and he can see other users based on their profile.(we will use firebase database to read and update the user profile)
    1. He can enter whether he wants to be a player, a DM or both.
    2. He can update their name, email, password etc.
1. The user sends messages to other users and he can create a party for other people to join.
    2. He can also block and/or report users


### When the party is created:

1. When the party is created, next to each user there will be the role that each user has and different color based on the role.
    Suggestion:
    1. Red for the Dungeon Master
    2. Green for the players
2. There will be a group chat that will be used by the players to be able to contact with each other.

Since I will be using [Firebase](https://questmatch2023.web.app) to host the app, the front end will be made using firebase hosting and the backend using firebase functions.

1. Back End:

Nodejs as this is the programming language formally suported by Google to create firebase functions.

2. Front End:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[![React][React.js]][React-url]

ReactJS is simple and can be used to create a real-time application. It additionally has a number of external apps you can use to generate the code easier. Therefore, it will be beneficial to use this JavaScript Framework.

Please write clean code and insert comments so that other users can see what you have been doing and continue to improve the code.

## What features can you add?

You can basically add any feature you want. There are no limitations but you have to follow some very basic rules(no bad language of any kind etc.) Any new feature, new design etc are welcome.

## ⚠️ Important: Assigning Issues

A very important action when deciding to implement a new feature is to **assign the issue you want to work on to yourself**. This helps prevent multiple contributors from working on the same feature simultaneously.
