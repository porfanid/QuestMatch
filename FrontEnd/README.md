(Whatever you desire to add to the features)

### How to contribute

You can contributee by developing the features I want the app to have, plus add any features you think you would like to see in an app like that. (Please do not use bad language).

### Programming Language

The programming language that will be used for the front end will be vue js.
This is because the app needs to be real time and quite fast for people to be able to operate it as fast as possible
